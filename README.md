# Overview
For this weekâ€™s module, I built a ping-pong game using Java programming language. This project allowed me to work with programming tools and concepts such as classes, methods, functions, loops, condition statements, lists, abstractions, encapsulation, and other tools available in Java. The project has helped me gain a real working experience in using code to solve logical problems efficiently. 

Ping-pong is a game where a player controls a paddle to bounce a ball. The goal is to prevent the ball from falling off the screen while scoring points by hitting it.
